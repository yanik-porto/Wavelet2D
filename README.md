# Wavelet2D
Apply a wavelet decomposition on an image and reconstruct from the coefficient

## launch_wavelet.m
*Decompose the original image in multiple levels of wavelet transform
*Reconstruct the image from a certain percentage of the coefficients

## launch_wavelet_noise.m
*Add noise on the original image
*Decompose the original image in multiple levels of wavelet transform
*Estimate the noise thanks to the first scales of the decomposition
*Apply hard or soft thresholding 
*Reconstruct the image
